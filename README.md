As of 2022, I've been working with Ruby on Rails for about 6 years. It's been relatively informal
to date, on my own time for growth and self-development purposes, with potentially career options 
further in the future. I've built a few web applications, completed the Ruby Koans, and received 
a Coursera certification in Ruby on Rails - but I made the critical mistake of keeping these 
projects private, rather than enabling visibility of these successes on venues such as Github.

So, in this and other repos, you'll find some fresh examples of my Ruby and RoR practice - some
based on The Complete Ruby on Rails Developer Course on Udemy, others based on my own interest
and initiative.

This particular repo is focused on one-shot Ruby scripts. They are all intended to be standalone
exercises in applying Ruby to various challenges. All scripts have a documentation header
describing their intent and usage, so review should be pretty easy. If you have any questions,
feel free to ping me on the repo or LinkedIn - I'm very easy to find. Thanks!
